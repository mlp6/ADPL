2016-01-20 Siji Meeting Notes
=============================

Siji expressed interest in working in a more hardware-oriented project, so she'll be doing a research project with me this spring / fall with the following objectives: 

 * Understand the current Uno software 

 * Design a test box to verify all of the GPIO functionality of the
   microcontroller.  This will be used for both in-house and field testing.
 
 * Help with the migration to the Particle platform for cellular data transfer and alerts.
