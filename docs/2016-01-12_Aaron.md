2016-01-12 Meeting w/ Aaron Notes
=================================

Some delayed meeting notes from getting together with Aaron to discuss
direction of the project this semester.  The GitHub repository  Issues have
documented some of the specific items, but in summary: 

 * Will design a test box for testing Uno and new microcontrollers 

 * Will migrate over to the Particle Photon (eventually Electron) for cellular data collection and alerts 

 * SD card will be removed with the cellular data collection, removing a big
   bottleneck with the Uno implementation (specifically, the code overhead to
   communicate with the SD card) 

 * Expand thermocouple capacity from 5 -> 7 
 
We also need to design a more robust enclosure, including hardware mounting and
better wire connection to the box from the outside transducers, motors and
power supplies.
